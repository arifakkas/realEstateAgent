# Real Estate Management System
SE 311 course project, Real Estate Management System

A customer can:

-> Sign up and Sign in

-> Give an estate to rent or sell

-> Register his/her preferences and then when an estate added to system user can be notified

-> Check all estates which match with his/her preferences

-> Check all the estates with a given type(House, Land, Store)


An agent can:

-> Delete customers and estates

-> Delete estates which are on the system more than 6 months by one method

-> Get the inventory count

-> See all the users signed up to system

-> See all estates which are wanted to sell or rent by the customers

                
Patterns used on this project:

-> Observer Pattern to notify the customers

-> Singleton Pattern to maintaining only one real estate agency agent and on concrete subjects of the Observer Pattern to avoid collisions

-> Factory Pattern to create estates

-> Iterator pattern to parse arraylists of customers and estates

-> Command pattern to increase cohesion and to decrease coupling
